; by default, the SSID will be generated from a hash of the serial and the key will 
; be the default pairing key (completely insecure). for demo networks, set a secure
; key (and maybe SSID) here.
; full-network-access specifies whether clients connecting to this AP should have 
; access to all listening services. this is used in demo mode when the key is 
; specified, but not during setup/pairing. without this option all non-setup packets
; from the network will be DROPPED SILENTLY
; always-active specifies whether the network should always be made available.
; by default, it will only be active when needed for pairing.
